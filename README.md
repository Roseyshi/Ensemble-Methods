This project aims at identifying how ensemble methods improve the performance of a model. Models may not predict accurately on their own but when combined increase the r2_score and decrease the RMSE. Ensemble methods are either heterogenous or homogenous. Homogenous methods, we use different versions of the same model, while with heterogenous we combine several different models and use either voting or stacking to identify which model performs the best. Homogenous methods may use bagging or boosting in selecting training data. Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble method that employs bootstrapping in selecting subsets of training data and feature selection. The different trees' predictions' are either averaged for regression tasks or voted for classification tasks.
I will be using sklearn.ensemble library to fetch the diffrent methods and sklearn.metrics to calcaulate the RMSE, R2_score and the mean squared error.
